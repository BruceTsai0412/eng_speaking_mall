When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, [1.0s] you're
gonna see some serious shit. 

[47.8s] What did I tell you? 88 miles per hour! 
[2.7s] The temporal displacement occurred exactly 1.20 AM in zero
seconds! 

[3.3s] Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ, Doc. You
disintegrated Einstein.
Calm down, Marty. I didn't disintegrate anything. The molecular structure of both
Einstein and the car are completely intact. [1.1s]
Where the hell are they? The appropriate question is,
when the hell are they? You see, Einstein has just
become the world's first time traveler. I sent him into
the future. [1.2s] One minute into the future, to be
exact. And precisely 1.21 a.m. in zero seconds, we
shall catch up with him at the time machine. [4.1s]
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you telling me
that you built a time machine?
[2.2s] Out of a DeLorean? The way I see it, if you're
gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it
with some style? Besides, the stainless steel
construction made the flux dispersal... [1.7s] Look out!
[46.0s] Why, what, is it hot? It's cold, [2.4s] damn
cold. I'm sorry, you little devil. [2.7s] Einstein's clock is
exactly one minute behind mine and still ticking!
[4.0s] He's all right. He's fine! And he's completely
unaware that anything happened. As far as he's
concerned, the trip was instantaneous. That's why his
watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped
over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in
time. Come here. I'll show you how it works. All right.
[2.5s] First, you turn the time circuits on. [4.6s] This
readout tells you where you're going.
This one tells you where you are. This one tells you
where you were. You input your destination time on
this keypad. Say you want to see the signing of the
Declaration of Independence. [3.3s] Or witness the
birth of Christ. [4.0s] Here's the red-letter date in the
history of science. November 5th, 1955. Yes. [6.7s] Of
course, November 5th, 1955. What? I don't get what
happened. [1.8s] That was the day I invented time
travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the
edge of my toilet, hanging a clock. The porcelain was
wet. I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink.
And when I came to, I had a revelation, a vision, a
picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what
makes time travel possible.
The flux capacitor. What's capacitor? It's taken me
almost 30 years and my entire family fortune to realize
the vision of that day. [1.4s] My God, has it been that
long? [1.3s] Things have certainly changed around
here. [2.3s] I remember when this was all farmland as
far as the eye could see. Old [2.4s] man Peabody
owned all of this. [1.3s] He had this crazy idea about
breeding pine trees. [2.6s] Come on. [1.4s] This is,
uh, this is heavy duty, Doc. This is great. Uh, does it
run like on regular unleaded gasoline? Unfortunately,
no. It requires something with a little more kick.
