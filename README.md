# About
This project is part of my Final Year Project for the Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in English Studies and Digital Communication at The Education University of Hong Kong (EduHK). The aim of this project is to design a Mobile Assisted Language Learning (MALL) application.

## Language Learning App: Enhancing English Speaking Skills through Movies and Videos
The Language Learning App is a Mobile Assisted Language Learning (MALL) application designed to help English language learners improve their confidence and fluency in speaking English. By utilizing movies and online videos, the app offers a variety of interactive exercises and activities that focus on real-world communication scenarios. Learners can engage in role-playing and voice-over exercises, allowing them to practice speaking in a safe and supportive environment.

## Problem
Speaking fluent English can be challenging, especially for those who lack opportunities to practice in real-life situations. English language learners often struggle with speaking confidently, leading to difficulties in effective communication. This problem is particularly evident in secondary and university students, English Non-Native speakers, and English language learners in general. Existing solutions, such as language-learning apps like Duolingo, fall short in providing learners with the necessary skills to speak English fluently in real-world scenarios.

## Justification
The lack of self-confidence in speaking English is a significant obstacle for many non-native English language learners. It can stem from concerns about accents, grammar, or pronunciation. This lack of confidence hinders learners' progress in language acquisition. It is crucial to create opportunities for learners to practice speaking English in a safe and supportive environment to boost their confidence and enhance their communication skills. Additionally, the learning resource for training in English speaking is often limited compared to other aspects of English language learning, such as reading and writing. This highlights the need for alternative avenues for students to develop their speaking abilities.

Utilizing movies and online videos as learning materials offers several advantages. Learners can experience real-life language conversations, which provide context for understanding appropriate intonation, speaking speed, and syllable stress necessary for fluent speaking. Learning within a context-rich environment helps learners grasp the complexities and variations of spoken English encountered in everyday life. The effectiveness of using authentic sources like movies, songs, and TV series for language learning is exemplified by Jackie Chan's experience in learning English.

## Proposed Solution: Language Learning App
The Language Learning App is designed as a MALL app targeting local secondary students and above. It leverages movies and online videos as learning materials to offer engaging and interactive exercises and activities. Users have the option to choose from different genres of movies, such as horror, sci-fi, comedy, and more. Within each genre, learners can select specific scenes that interest them. The app provides necessary context and dialogue lines of different characters for study. Once familiar with the scene, learners can perform their own voice-over of the scene, practicing their speaking skills in a realistic setting. The app also includes self-assessment and reflection features, allowing learners to review and improve their speaking abilities. Additionally, the app offers the flexibility for users and teachers to create custom scripts based on specific scenarios or lesson plans.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Language Learning App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies and libraries.

3. Launch the app on your mobile device or emulator.
